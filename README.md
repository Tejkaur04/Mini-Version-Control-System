# 🚀 Mini VCS

A Git-inspired Version Control System built from scratch using **Java, Spring Boot, React, and custom data structures**.

Mini VCS allows users to track files, create commits, manage branches, visualize repository history, and monitor repository status through an interactive web dashboard.

## 🧩 Custom Data Structures

To better understand the internals of version control systems, several data structures were implemented from scratch and integrated into the project:

* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Hash Table
* Binary Search Tree

These structures are used throughout the repository, commit, and version management modules.

---

## 🔗 Full Stack Integration

The Version Control System was originally implemented as a Java application.

To make it interactive and easier to visualize, a Spring Boot API layer was built on top of the core VCS engine. The React frontend communicates with these APIs to display repository data in real time.

## 📊 Commit Graph Visualization

One of the core features of Mini VCS is the dynamic commit graph.

The graph is generated directly from repository commit history and visualized using React Flow.

Features include:

* Dynamic node generation
* Parent-child commit relationships
* HEAD commit highlighting
* Real-time updates from backend APIs
* Interactive repository history visualization

Example:

```text
debug
  │
  ▼
next
  │
  ▼
hello (HEAD)
```

Unlike static diagrams, the graph is generated entirely from actual commit data.

## 📈 Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides a real-time overview of repository activity.

### Repository Insights

* Active branches
* Tracked files
* Current HEAD commit

### Repository Status

* Modified files
* Deleted files
* Untracked files
* Working tree health

### Recent Activity

## 💡 Challenges Solved

During development, several interesting problems were addressed:

* Designing commit-parent relationships
* Implementing branch tracking and checkout functionality
* Building file version management using SHA-1 hashes
* Exposing a Java-based VCS through REST APIs
* Synchronizing frontend visualizations with backend repository data
* Generating dynamic commit graphs from repository history
* Integrating custom data structures into a real-world application
